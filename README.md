## Venue Section
The Venue Section maps all performing arts centers within 3 km of the University of Toronto, serving as the project's focal point.

1. Map Design & Data Integration
The interactive Mapbox base map is styled using:
Style URL: mapbox://styles/zoezhuoli/cm6segkif005101qs25x0avo9
The GeoJSON point dataset overlays cultural venues on the map.
2. Dynamic Interaction
Fly-to Feature: As users scroll through venue descriptions, the map automatically flies to the corresponding location.
Connecting Routes:
- Pink lines represent TTC (public transit) routes connecting the University of Toronto to venues.
- Blue lines indicate walking paths between the campus and venues.

## Work in Progress
The project is actively being expanded with new features:
- Detailed descriptions for each venue.
- Animated transportation routes for an immersive city experience.
- Enhanced UI/UX improvements for better interactivity.
